* CS321 BTree project                *
* driver class for creating a BTree  *
* creates a BTree from a subsequence *
* of DNA given by the input file     *
* these sequences are coded into a   *
* binary representation and combined *
* into a 64-bit long                 *
*                                    *
* DNA-binary coding:                 *
*    Adenine  00                     *
*    Thiamine 11                     *
*    Cytosine 01                     *
